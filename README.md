Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a major financial services firm in need of a safe and dependable software solution to manage customer transactions. They wanted us to solve security flaws in their existing system while also improving overall speed.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
I conducted a thorough investigation and discovered many significant security flaws in the client's program. Our methodical approach and use of cutting-edge security techniques were critical in detecting these problems quickly.Secure coding is critical for protecting sensitive information and maintaining consumer confidence. Software security delivers value to a firm like Artemis Financial by reducing risks, guaranteeing regulatory compliance, and retaining a competitive edge in the market.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The most difficult component was precisely detecting hidden vulnerabilities while maintaining system operation. The use of automated scanning techniques in conjunction with manual testing was beneficial in this procedure.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I strengthened security by instituting robust authentication, encryption, and frequent security audits. We would use threat modeling and risk assessment frameworks in the future to decide on mitigation measures.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I went through a thorough testing procedure that includes both functional and security testing. We performed regression testing after rewriting the code to guarantee that no new vulnerabilities were created.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Using tools like OWASP ZAP and adhering to best practices like the concept of least privilege were beneficial. These techniques and tools will surely come in handy for future jobs or undertakings.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I was able to deliver a complete case study based on this assignment, including the initial vulnerability assessment, the refactoring process, and the final secure and working application. The enhanced security measures and methods would reflect my abilities, knowledge, and expertise.
